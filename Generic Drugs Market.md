<p data-start="389" data-end="976">The generic drugs market is expected to witness steady growth during the forecast period, driven by increasing demand for affordable healthcare solutions, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and the increasing number of off-patent drugs. As the healthcare system across the globe increasingly focuses on cost-efficiency, generic drugs play a critical role in providing affordable treatment options to patients, while maintaining the same quality and efficacy as branded drugs. This growth trend is expected to continue, with the market showing strong promise for the coming years.</p>
<h3 data-start="978" data-end="1003"><strong data-start="982" data-end="1003">Market Definition</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1005" data-end="1623">Generic drugs are pharmaceutical products that are identical to their branded counterparts in terms of dosage, strength, administration route, and intended use, but are marketed under their chemical name rather than a brand name. Once the patent protection for a branded drug expires, other manufacturers can produce the drug under its generic name. Generic drugs offer the same therapeutic benefits at a significantly lower cost, making them a more affordable option for patients and healthcare systems. As the global demand for affordable healthcare increases, the generic drugs market is expected to expand rapidly.</p>
